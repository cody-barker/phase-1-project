# Welcome to the Portland Native Plant Page


## Description

This page contains a list with a large number of plants native to the Portland Metro area in NW Oregon. I originally created the data in an excel sheet many years ago while working as a botanical lead for a habitat restoration company called Ash Creek Forestry. I converted that original csv to JSON in order to create this page and make the data more accessible.

I created this page with the intention of making it easier for home owners and restoration teams alike, to make informed plant selections for their projects.

This list is not comprehensive for the entire region, and some species like baneberry were intentionally left out due to their high toxicity to both people and animals.

The header photo of a field of Camas is my own, taken at Gotter Prairie, one of only a handful of intact, wet meadows left in existence in NW Oregon.


## How to See the List

The api for the list is a database I created, and is only accessible via json-server hosted locally.
From the parent directory cody@holodiscus:~/code/labs/phase-1/phase-1-project, run json-server --watch db.json in order to serve up the database.
